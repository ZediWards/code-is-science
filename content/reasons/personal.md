## Personal and technical reasons why scientists don't share code

Includes topics such as personal motivations and technical impediments. _Based on the notes from the [MozFest Session 2017](https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/blob/master/content/posts/mozfest-session-2017.md)._

- embarrassment
- laziness
- ownership - "it's mine"
- lack of awareness about the possibility of sharing
- lack of knowledge about how to share code
- lack of incentive for sharing code - "nobody else would want it", "the default is to not share"
- expectations/burden of maintenance and documentation
- losing reputational value - "scared that other see code and features", "untidyness", "no facility for peer review of code", "giving away your advantage to the others"
- configuration and sanitisation of sentitive info (private keys, etc.)
